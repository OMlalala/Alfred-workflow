# Alfred-workflow

## Background

Hey everyone! I've created two workflows that allows you to search web pages.
This is my first workflow, let me know what all I messed up :)
Many thanks to [@zetavg](https://github.com/zetavg/alfred-google-translate-workflow) for some initial direction.

## Demand

I'm searching for the great investor's information recently, and put information in Zotero groups library.

The information include autobiography, the letter to shareholders, books(English version, Simplified Chinese version, Traditional Chinese version ), and etc.

So, I have to repeatedly search from web pages like Google, wiki, amazon, valuewalk, and etc.

## Workflow

With curiosity and excitement, I set two workflows.
- Search investor in multiple webpages
  - installation: Download the workflow from GitHub 链接
  - function: search investor's information in English version and Traditional Chinese version
  - usage: us + investor's name
  - example:

- Search books in Amazon China
  - installation: Download the workflow from GitHub 链接
  - function: search investor's books in Simplified Chinese version
  - usage: cn + investor's name
  - example:
